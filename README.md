# OC7 Loan application dashboard

This repo displays a dashboard to evaluate the solvability of loan applicants. 
The API is powered by Flask while the dashboard runs on Streamlit.

I made this as part of my 8-project-long Data Science course with OPENCLASSROOM.
Any (constructive) criticism is welcome :).
